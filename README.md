# StaticTimingAnalysis
In this project we will calculate the delay of a circuit by performing static timing analysis (STA) on it. Each node of the graph corresponds to each gate of the circuit, while each edge denotes a wire connection.

Hi,
ReadLib.h --> Header file containing the class of objects of Different GATES parsed from NLDM LUT
ReadLibFunc.h -->Header file containing funstions to read, write Class objects of ReadLib.h
RdCkt.cpp--> Main file that parse the circuit files and perform STA

**************************************************************************************************
Steps to compile and Run

1. make
2. ./sta <NLDM Filename> <Ckt filename>
